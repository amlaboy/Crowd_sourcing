# Crowd_sourcing
# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
For our alalysis we started with a data set with information about kickstarter campaigns. 


## Analysis and Challenges
To get a better view, we filtered the data by factors such as time, goal and outcome. Our dates of when campaigns started and ended was provided in unix code. So the the challange I encountered was was converting into a standard date format. With dates in the correct format we were able to put them into a pivot chart. We used the "=Countifs" function to group the to see how many campagins fell into set goal ranges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
People who launched campaigns in May and June Had the most success. In December the number of those who succeeded and those who failed were very close.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Campaigns with a goal lower than 10000 had noticably more success.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
